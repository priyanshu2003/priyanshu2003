# Notes, Assignments, and Reports of IISER - Kolkata

- This repository includes all my freshman year notes, assignments, project reports and lab reports at IISER - Kolkata as a student.
- It will contain \LaTeX\ as well as handwritten documents of the said assignments/reports and my python projects while I attempt to learn and use `NumPy`, `SciPy`, `MatPlotLib`, `SymPy`, `Numba`, `Pandas`, etc. in my homeworks and assignments.
- I acknowledge the use of `evan.sty` package provided/distributed by Evan Chen, MIT for the stylisation and better organisation of my LaTeX documents.
